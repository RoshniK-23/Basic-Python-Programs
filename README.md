11. Armstrong Number Check
Description: Determines whether a number is an Armstrong number, where the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits equals the original number.
Input: A positive integer num.
Output: "Armstrong Number" or "Not an Armstrong Number".

12. Armstrong Numbers in a Given Range
Description: Finds all Armstrong numbers within a specified range, demonstrating nested loops and digit manipulation.
Input: Two integers, n1 and n2.

Description: Checks if a number is a Strong number, where the sum of the factorials of its digits equals the number itself.
Input: A positive integer num.
Output: "Strong Number" or "Not a Strong Number".

19. Perfect Number Check
Description: Determines whether a number is perfect, meaning the sum of its divisors (excluding the number itself) equals the number.
Input: A positive integer num.
Output: "Perfect Number" or "Not a Perfect Number".

20. Automorphic Number Check
Description: Checks whether a number is automorphic, meaning its square ends in the same digits as the number itself.
Input: A positive integer num.
Output: "Automorphic Number" or "Not an Automorphic Number".

Description: Determines whether a number is a Harshad number, meaning it is divisible by the sum of its digits.
Input: A positive integer num.
Output: "Harshad Number" or "Not a Harshad Number".

22. Abundant Number Check
Description: Checks if a number is abundant, meaning the sum of its divisors (excluding the number itself) is greater than the number.
Input: A positive integer num.
Output: "Abundant Number" or "Not an Abundant Number".

23. Friendly Pairs Check
Description: Determines whether two numbers are friendly pairs, based on the ratio of the sum of their divisors to the number itself.
